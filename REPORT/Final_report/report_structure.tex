Evaluation criteria:
\begin{list}{-}{ }
	\item Project Management | current content is good but more is required than in the progress report
	\item Technical approach | clearer requirements, discuss evaluation strategies??
	\item Testing and Evaluation | talk about unit testing, integration testing (which was limited to interface generation and system penetration testing done using the tool) 
	\item Achievement | 
	\item Main report | literature review is as needed, good writing style, add about pen testing in general
	\item Knowledge and understanding (+ Presentation)
\end{list}

	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Project specifications and Analysis
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Requirements
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Functional
			\item Non-Functional
		\end{enumerate}
		\item Scope (limitations)
		\item Risk analysis
		\item Existing alternatives
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Possible problem approaches
			\item Chosen Approach
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Design
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Class diagrams and planning
			\item Platform choice - desktop app
			\item Tools and Techniques
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Language choice
				\item Libraries choice (QT - native gui, means that shortcuts work as well)
				\item Development environment
				\item Source control
				\item Techniques
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item Design patterns used (mvc, observer(signal-slot), add some more)
				\end{enumerate}
			\end{enumerate}
		\item Application structure (discuss parts of the class diagram)
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item main - IntefaceLoader - configManager - (other high level interfaces) connection
			\item InterfaceLoader - Interface - InterfaceGui connection
			\item InterfaceGui generation
			\item Manager - Worker - job - response pattern
			\item ThreatModel - Asset - Technoliogy - EntryPoint - Threat structure
			\item Each tab Gui - each tab Gui Controller - ThreatModelGuiController - ThreatModel
			
		\item importing new tools to the toolset as easy as creating a yml file (is not indended to be used by unexperienced users)
		\item toolset categorization
	\end{enumerate}
			
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Implementation details
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item re-iterate MVC pattern and split front-end and back-end 
		
		\item third part code used
		
		\item earlier designs and prototyping
		
		\item User preferences and setting files
		\item Interface loader and yml parsing
		\item Interface generation, recursion and extendability
		\item Multithreaded run and options to stop execution
		\item Dynamically bind seperate output for each interface - output abstraction using functional programming
		\item Interface tabular structure in accordance with methodology tool separation
		
		\item Threat Model design using tabular structure 
		\item Dynamic and responsive information display kept up to date in multiple places using QT signal-slot pattern
		\item Global scope Threat Model item cache (remembers entered values even between separate Threat Models to easy repetitive assets imports)
		\item Threat rating according to DREAD and every part add-edit-delete capabilities
		\item Interface flag and value suggestion generation in extendable manner parsing only current threat information (done in native style as text completion)
		
		\item Threat Model persistence via pickling
		\item Expected tool interface for new/open/save and save as with keyboard shortcuts and, obviously, remembering saved file existence, remembrance of saved/unsaved state and verification before discarding unsaved information
		\item Inter version compatibility due to pickling (can load not exactly the same attribute files and fill in not existing attributes with defaults)
		\item export to tabulated json as a universal format
		\item Global cache clearance separated into assets/technologies and entry points
		
		\item Toolset provided - talk about each of the tools in the toolset
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item apktool
			\item binwalk
			\item dirb
			\item hcitool
			\item hydra
			\item nmap
			\item sdptool
			\item sqlmap
			\item wfuzz
		\end{enumerate}
		
		\item scalability (not very good, it is expected that people don't use too many tools as it wouldn't be convenient for them)
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Testing
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item unit testing
		\item integration testing (only for interface gui generation)
		\item testing usefulness by pen testing IoT system
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Project management
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Test driven development
		\item Agile planning
		\item MoSCoW prioriterization
		\item Sprints scheduled as supervisor meetings
		\item Commit history
		\item rapid development
		\item Gannt charts (planned? actual?)
		\item Project management evaluation
		\begin{enumerate}

			\item Time sinks
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{enumerate}
