\section{Testing}\label{testing}
Project testing was performed in two ways: software testing during Test-Driven (TD) development and a tool use case analysis. 

\subsection{Software testing}
	As it has been mentioned before, application testing process has been integrated into software development by following TD development method. Full test log can be found in appendix \ref{sec:appendix-software-tests}.

	\subsubsection{Unit testing and Integration testing}
	For each individual piece of software functionality an appropriate unit test had been created before starting implementation. Then a function passing that test was written. Afterwards, more test cases were added to test alteration in control flow, finally code was refactored to comply with all tests cases.
	
	Following this workflow appropriate pieces of code were tested during their development. It also matches with individual Sprints, therefore, fully tested pieces of software were presented during each after-Sprint supervisor meeting.
	
	Software test log in Appendix \ref{sec:appendix-software-tests} is a mixture of Unit and Integration tests. Due to the TD process, their distinction is not obvious as some cases test combination of object functionalities (e.g. parsing and creation of interface files) and others only specific functions (e.g. adding a new Asset object to ThreatModel).


	\subsubsection{GUI testing}
	Prototypes GUI was tested using manual testing process during development. Programs GUI was not a priority for this project and not as in-depth testing has been completed for it as for the back-end software part. Programs GUI functionality has been checked again during the Usability testing phase.
