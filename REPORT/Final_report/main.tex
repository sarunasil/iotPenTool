\section{Project brief}\label{sec:appendix-preject-brief}

Internet of Things (IoT) Penetration Testing Toolset

Sarunas Iljeitis (si1g16)

Supervised by Dr Julian Rathke (jr2)

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Problem:
	
	Nowadays people tend to use more and more low-end consumer-based electronics. Such sensor based or smart-devices are used to create highly automated networks (IoT networks) that assist humans in performing various tasks. Unfortunately, product manufacturers are driven by ever-increasing demand for highly functional affordable gadgets, because of that security is usually not their top priority. The current IoT gadget market is filled with low-quality inexpensive devices that implement poor security standards. Some security vulnerabilities could be easily prevented by device users simply following mutual security standards guidelines. As consumers are usually negligent to properly secure their new gadgets and device manufacturers are more concerned about minimizing the production cost such devices become favorable targets for attackers wishing to compromise ownerâ€™s network.
	\item Goal:
	
	Penetration testing is an essential aspect of any modern device, application or network development. It is the single most effective way of finding security breaches before the actual attack happens. The goal of this project is to provide a set of tools that can be automatically applied to IoT networks or individual devices to scan for common IoT vulnerabilities. The toolset is intended to be used to find vulnerable devices which use different communication methods, apply customizable vulnerability tests and provide test results in a report. The toolset would follow most common IoT device testing methodology and vulnerability testing best practice.
	\item Scope:
	
	This project cannot possibly find all existing IoT device vulnerabilities nor address specific device level implementation details; thus, it will only check for most frequent IoT device weak points. The toolset will concentrate on testing mutual device properties providing a certain level of configuration for different tests following common testing patterns. It will not however be able to expand over bigger IoT infrastructures as it concentrates on testing singular devices or a small set of devices on the same network.

\section{Risk management} \label{sec:appendix-risk}
Probability and Impact are rated in a scale from 1 to 5.

\def\riska{Loss of source code at some stage of development}
\def \probabilitya {1}
\def \impacta {4}
\def \mitigationa {Use of remote source control  repository to frequently record every stage of the development, thus being able to recover it if needed. }

\def\riskaa{Unable to fulfill all of the requirements due to technical implemention difficulties}
\def \probabilityaa {3}
\def \impactaa {2}
\def \mitigationaa {At the start of development process requirements will be split into tasks, divided into sprints and ranked using MoSCoW prioritization, therefore ensuring that core functionality will be implemented first and a working proof of concept is available at the end of the project }

\def\riskaaa{Insufficient time to develop a prototype due to other course modules}
\def \probabilityaaa {2}
\def \impactaaa {2}
\def \mitigationaaa {Dedicate fixed amount of time every week for the project in order to keep up with the schedule }

\def\riskaaaa{Some part of the project taking up significantly longer that expected}
\def \probabilityaaaa {3}
\def \impactaaaa {2}
\def \mitigationaaaa {Re-evaluate task importance and re-adjust development schedule in order to deliver functional product }

\def\riskaaaaa{Unable to complete adequate application testing due to technical or time limitations}
\def \probabilityaaaaa {3}
\def \impactaaaaa {3}
\def \mitigationaaaaa {Complete limited or partial testing concentrating on core functionality, document causes and reasoning. If difficulties arise in early stages of development  due to technical limitations, seek support from university staff that are experienced in such situations. }

\def\riskaaaaaa{Development is halted as additional research is needed}
\def \probabilityaaaaaa {3}
\def \impactaaaaaaa {2}
\def \mitigationaaaaaa {Re-adjust project schedule and shorten over planned activities in order to accompany expected delay.}


\def\riskaaaaaaa{it is impossible to achieve a requirement during the given time frame}
\def \probabilityaaaaaaa {1}
\def \impactaaaaaa {2}
\def \mitigationaaaaaaa {Alter project goals to be more realistic and update time schedule taking that into account. Impact largely depends on the stage of development. In the prototyping period impact is insignificant, although, in later stages can become troublesome}
