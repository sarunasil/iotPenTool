\section{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my project supervisor, Dr Julian Rathke, for his feedback, ideas and advice during the development of this project, as well as keeping me on track and helping me to prioritize my work.

I would also like to thank all the family members that dedicated their time to proofread my report pointing out grammatical errors.
