Internet of Things (IoT) devices can be incredibly useful for everyday activities and are used for a wide range of applications. Unfortunately, securing these devices is not always the manufacturers top priority. This introduces a new, numerous and questionably protected subset of Internet connected assets. Penetration testing can be used to point out security faults and vulnerabilities that are most likely to be exploited by a malicious entities. 

This project aims to simplify IoT network penetration testing providing clear guidelines as well as a tool to assist in penetration testing which requires little technical knowledge. It covers methods used to identify and map IoT network components and provide guidelines on how to test individual devices. Apart from the threat model this project provides a tool that automates network scanning, device discovery and information gathering process. The key piece of the tool functionality is its extend-ability and versatility allowing new modules to be easily included depending on users needs.

This report provides insights into progress made up to this date. Describes background research, chosen application structure and design decisions taken up to this point. It also includes the time schedule for application implementation and remaining work.
