\section{Project management} \label{project-man}
This section covers time and workload management during the whole project development period. It explains important project planning decisions, covers strategies used for time planning and work distribution. It also compares project schedule from the Progress report with the final project schedule. Finally, it evaluates project management and explains divinations from the initial plan.

\subsection{Early prototyping period}
	At the end of the first semester exam period, it has become clear that before proper development could start, some degree of experimentation is required. Firstly, experiments to familiarise with Qt development patterns, functionality and convenience software were needed. Then, research to data structures parsing, finally settling with yaml data format. Thirdly, some time was needed to test command line string generation and execution in the terminal from Python.
	
	Unfortunately, there was a need for more background research especially in the specific penetration tools that would be most suitable to perform test for IoT devices. The delays shifted the project schedule few weeks and postponed actual prototype creation. 
	
	\subsection{Test driven development}
	From the start of the project Test-Driven development (TDD) technique has been chosen as the most time and resource efficient way of delivering robust code. Due to the delay suffered from the early prototyping phase, development schedule had to be pushed into a narrow window with little to no time for other setbacks. The code had to be developed efficiently, according to Sprint plan and fully tested. 
	
	As each Sprint was finalized by a supervisor meeting during which working code had to be provided, a high risk of (un)intentional cutting of corners was possible. TDD approach was ideal for such setup in order to ensure proper software testing and delivery of working code.
