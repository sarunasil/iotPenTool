\section{Remaining work}

Work completed up to this point and the remaining work is visualized using Gannt chart. The application design and background research phases are completed. The remaining development time will be mostly divided into sprints of 10-14 days in order to assign time for inevitable other module assignments. Each sprint will have a predefined set of tasks prioritized in Agile manner. After the sprint is completed planned functionality is supposed to be fully functional and tested to constantly add value. The Christmas period, January exam period and Easter periods are planned in looser manner in order to accommodate vacations, assess progress and re-think design decisions. The last weeks of the project are reserved for writing final report.

\subsection{Risk analysis}
Probability and Impact are rated in a scale from 1 to 5.

\def\riska{Loss of source code at some stage of development}
\def \probabilitya {1}
\def \impacta {4}
\def \mitigationa {Use of remote source control  repository to frequently record every stage of the development, thus being able to recover it if needed. }

\def\riskaa{Unable to fulfill all of the requirements due to technical implemention difficulties}
\def \probabilityaa {3}
\def \impactaa {2}
\def \mitigationaa {During the start of development process requirements will be split into tasks, divided into sprints and ranked using Agile methodology, therefore ensuring that core functionality will be implemented first and a working proof of concept is available at the end of the project }

\def\riskaaa{Loss of development time due to other course modules}
\def \probabilityaaa {2}
\def \impactaaa {2}
\def \mitigationaaa {Dedicate fixed amount of time every week for the project in order to keep up with the schedule }

\def\riskaaaa{Some part of the project taking up significantly longer that expected}
\def \probabilityaaaa {3}
\def \impactaaaa {2}
\def \mitigationaaaa {Re-evaluate task importance and readjust development schedule in order to deliver functional prototype }

\def\riskaaaaa{Unable to complete adequate application testing due to technical or time limitations}
\def \probabilityaaaaa {3}
\def \impactaaaaa {3}
\def \mitigationaaaaa {Complete limited or partial testing concentrating on core functionality, document causes and reasoning. If difficulties arise in early stages of development  due to technical limitations, seek support from university staff that have more experience in similar situations. }
