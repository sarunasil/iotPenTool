This tool was created to solve the problem of lack of clarity and usability of penetration testing in a IoT technology environment. It seems that penetration testing if not the integration testing in general is a rather side topic and not a definite must for IoT developing companies. Therefore, this project tries to solve this problem by providing an little skill requiring toolset that allows users to employ tested and trusted penetration tools to do penetration testing themselves by following instructions. That is a clear advantage and narrows the gap between developers and security experts in hopes of advertising penetration testing techniques and providing means for developers to test their own software.


Evaluation criteria:
\begin{list}{-}
	\item Project Management | current content is good but more is required than in the progress report
	\item Technical approach | clearer requirements, discuss evaluation strategies??
	\item Testing and Evaluation | talk about unit testing, integration testing (which was limited to interface generation and system penetration testing done using the tool) 
	\item Achievement | 
	\item Main report | literature review is as needed, good writing style, add about pen testing in general
	\item Knowledge and understanding (+ Presentation)
\end{list}
